        <h2>(h2) A sample sentence using the heading size of h2</h2>
        <h3>(h3) It can be noticed that the font sizes are getting smaller and smaller.</h3>
        <h4>(h4) Here is a sample sentence using the heading size of h4</h4>
        <h5>(h5) Meanwhile, another interesting fact about heading is that...</h5>
        <h6>(h6) You cannot insert two headings with different size at the same line.</h6>

        <h2>DIFFERENCE OF < br > and < p ></h2>

        <br>Starting from <b>< br ></b>, here is an example of how it is used.
        <br>It can be observed that for every new sentences, 
        <br>a new line is forcefully created.
    
        <p>Meanwhile as for <b>< p ></b>, will  add  a  blank  line before it starts your new paragraph</p>
        <p>which can be observed here unlike < br > who forcefully breaks a line and continues it on the next line.</p>

                        Into her hand:
                        I’d give <u>Bokhara</u> for the mole upon her cheek— 
                        Or Samarkand.</cite>
        </pre>
   <div align="center">
        <p><dd><blockquote> The <ins>conqueror Tamerlane</ins> had Hafiz brought before him and said:‘How can you give away Bokhara and Samarkand for a woman? Besides, they are in my own <kbd>domains</kbd>, and I shall not <code>permit</code> anyone to pretend that they are not!’ Hafiz said to him: <samp>‘Your  meanness  may  have  given  you  power. My  generosity has put me in your power. Your meanness is obviously more effective than my prodigality.’</samp> Tamerlane <strong>laughed</strong> and let the Sufi go.

                                                                A lot of white spaces could be observed from here.

                                                                                It will follow whatever and however you typed it

    <!--Another application of physical tag and logical tag-->

    <div align="center">
        <h2>PHYSICAL TAG</h2>
        <b>Sample bold text</b>
        <i>while this is an Italic text, another sample of course.</i>
        <p>Oh and this is for a <s>strikethrough</s> text.</p>
        <u>Anddd, this is how an underlined text looks like.</u><br>
        <br>Almost forgot, here is an application of a superscript<sup>1</sup> basically it looks like this, 
        <br>while this is how a subscript<sub>2</sub> is applied.<br>

        <h2>LOGICAL TAG</h2>
        <p>This is a sample of a <kbd>keyboard text</kbd></p>
        <p>Oh yeah, this too, almost forgot about <code>sample text</code> which is also the same like the previous one.</p>
        <p>This one looks definitely <del>familiar</del>, hmmm.</p>
